00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.870
In the front-end, select 'my
collection' from the menu and

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:08.757
here you'll find all your
processed videos. The search bar

00:00:08.823 --> 00:00:12.380
is useful for searching
filenames. So if you type in a

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:16.003
certain word, you'll get a
return of all the different

00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:20.350
files that match a term in their
file name. Simply delete that to

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:24.698
go back to all results, you have
a choice of sorting options. You

00:00:24.764 --> 00:00:28.848
can sort by the date the video
was created the duration of the

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:32.537
videos, or using matching
information like the count of

00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:36.555
related videos, or the count of
duplicate videos, meaning it

00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:40.573
would show the videos with the
most related content near the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:44.723
top. You can switch at any point
between videos in a thumbnail

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.820
grid to a straight list via the
toggle button.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.983
There are quick filters at the
top if you want to see all your

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.803
videos. Only videos that have
duplicate videos. Ones that have

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.546
possibly related content... or
unique videos that do not have

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:13.137
any matching videos in the
collection. Advanced filters are

00:01:13.213 --> 00:01:17.880
accessed via the button on the
right. You can filter by three

00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:22.623
different categories, the first
of which is content. Here you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.214
can set the length of videos
range you want to see. You can

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.575
also select match templates to
filter images by specific

00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:36.242
objects. We'll cover creating
your own templates later on in

00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:40.985
this course. In the metadata
category, you can filter by file

00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:45.269
extension. Search for videos
that are created between a

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:46.800
certain date range,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.310
filter by whether the video
contains audio or not. If you

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.430
want to look for files that are
local, as in they are from your

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.870
collection or files that come
from a partner collection. If

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.230
you choose the remote option,
you can also pick which partners

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.950
index you want to examine from
the drop down below. Once you

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.800
have a configuration you want,
you can save the filter as a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.610
preset saving you time in
future. Simply give it a name

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.300
and hit create. This will save
it under the preset sub menu

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.790
You can restore defaults anytime
to clear out the current filter

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:41.019
and start again or choose a
different preset. You can also

00:02:41.073 --> 00:02:43.919
hide the filter panes by
clicking the X at any time.

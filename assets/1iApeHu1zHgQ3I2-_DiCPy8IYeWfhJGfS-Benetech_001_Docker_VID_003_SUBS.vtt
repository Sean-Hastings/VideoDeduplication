00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.580
The first step is to download
and run the script found on the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:16.380
GitHub repository. Once the
script is downloaded, run bash

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.110
get docker.sh to run the script
to start Docker installation. It

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.560
will ask for your sudo password
to make sure that you're at the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.720
root and then it will install
Docker.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.740
Once installed you'll receive
the confirmation message. By

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.120
default, Docker can only run as
the root user. For best

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.750
practices, we should allow
Docker to be run by a non root

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.470
user, so you should copy and
paste the code to create a

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.850
Docker group. Next copy paste
the line of code to add your

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.170
user to the Docker group.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.510
To initiate those changes, you
can either log out and log back

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.200
in or you can activate them
within this terminal by copying

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.740
and pasting the "newgrp docker"
line of code you can find in the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.580
repository. Now you're added to
the Docker group, you can run

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.820
Docker, which will confirm that
it's been installed accurately.

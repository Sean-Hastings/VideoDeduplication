00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.139
Templates enable you to specify
reference images that can be

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:07.499
used to search all your videos
finding frames that contain

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:11.309
visually similar content. For
example, we've pre-created a

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.879
couple here, one for cat
containing two photos of a cat

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:19.679
that can then be used to find
similar frames. Also soccer

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:23.099
containing a couple of pictures
of soccer players, the images

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.809
can be previewed by clicking on
them.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.315
To create your own template,
click on 'add template'. You can

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:41.264
then pick a new icon for the
template by clicking on the

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.421
default one. For this scenario,
we're going to search for a

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.439
vehicle so you could type in
'truck', select an icon that

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:53.734
fits and then click 'done'. Now
you would give the template a

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:57.821
title in this case 'vehicle',
then hit 'create'. Next, you

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.047
will want to add references
images, so click on 'edit'. Then

00:01:02.116 --> 00:01:06.065
hit the plus symbol to go to
your folder browser. At this

00:01:06.134 --> 00:01:10.291
point, you can find and select
an image you want to use as a

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.300
reference for your template.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.692
And then hit 'done'. Your
template is now created so you

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:35.820
can head over to processing
using the left hand panel. Head

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:40.016
up to the task drop down and
select 'match templates'. Click

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:44.006
the 'run' button to start the
templating job. To view the

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:48.133
matches you can then head over
to my collection and use the

00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:51.780
filters menu to select any that
match your template.

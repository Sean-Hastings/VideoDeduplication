00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
The next step is to get the code
base from GitHub. Make sure to

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.980
change drives to where you want
to store the code base. Also

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.340
remove any old versions of the
code if you need to, so you're

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.870
starting fresh. Now write 'git
clone', then copy or type out

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.380
the repository name you can find
in the green code button dropped

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.370
down in GitHub. Alternatively,
you can download it as a zip

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.540
file if you prefer not to use
terminal. So now the code base

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.510
is cloned you can change
directories to get into its

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.800
folder, type 'LS' just to make
sure everything is complete, and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.690
you're done installing the code
base.

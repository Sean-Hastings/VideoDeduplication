00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.380
In your collection, you can use
the preset filters at the top to

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.910
show all videos. Show only
videos that contain exact

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.560
duplicates, videos that contain
related content, or unique files

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.660
that do not have matches in the
database.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.060
When you're exploring the
videos, you can click individual

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.970
thumbnails to un-blur them. Or
you can toggle blurring on or

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.480
off for all videos at once with
the switch above the search bar.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.990
This is useful for reducing
secondary trauma when reviewing

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.980
sensitive content.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.390
Each video thumbnail has
additional details underneath

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.100
it, including how many related
videos it has. You can click on

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:04.120
the Details to open up the
video. You can watch this video

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.640
and scrub through it by clicking
on the main image.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.760
Utilizing scene detection there
are video summary thumbnails

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.150
below, allowing you to quickly
scrub through the content. You

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.970
can either blur and reveal
specific ones by clicking on

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.120
them or toggle blurring for all
scenes from the button above.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:56.290
You can quickly jump to a scene
by clicking on the thumbnail. On

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.930
the right hand side you'll see
some high level video

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.310
information. Click on the
Metadata tab to see any metadata

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.510
collected from the file.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.520
You can also look for specific
metadata with the search bar at

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.290
the top. To look at similar
content, select the match

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.740
content tab at the top of the
page. This will show you all

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.130
other files sorted by their
similarity. The first result we

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:51.910
have is an exact match meaning
that when you play them side by

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.820
side, you can see that they're
the exact same video.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.840
You also have the scene summary
as well as video information and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.390
metadata side by side for
comparison. Return to the

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.580
matches by clicking the back
arrow at the top. Now if you

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.120
select a similar but not exact
match, you can see that it's a

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.050
very similar video but squashed.
There's maybe some additional

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.440
compression and it's also a
different size. It's similar

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.170
enough to be identified as a
match but not an exact

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:47.450
As an alternative to
scene-by-scene comparisons, you

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.650
duplicate.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.540
can also view an overall match
structure by clicking on the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.990
cluster tab up top. Here you
will find a network

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.500
visualisation of related
content. The black dot

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.860
represents the parent video that
you first started with. All

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.400
orange dots are related content
that are as far away as they are

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.090
related from the parent content.
More exact duplicates are very

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.320
close versus ones that might be
a couple of jumps away. A child

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.710
of a matching video might be
further away. You can explore

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.370
distances between the videos as
well as clicking in to explore a

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.240
distant match.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.430
Here we see a video that is a
similar scene in the movie, but

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.800
it's taped with a shaky handheld
camera. This allows you to step

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.010
back and find less similar but
still related content and

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.480
explore matches more deeply.

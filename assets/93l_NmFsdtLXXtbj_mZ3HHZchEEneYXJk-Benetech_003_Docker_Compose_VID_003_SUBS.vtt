00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.710
Go to the GitHub repository and
copy the code to install Docker

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.400
Compose.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.420
We recommend using a GPU for
processing, so you will need to

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.380
install a script that helps
Docker work with your GPU. You

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.680
can copy and paste this from the
code repository and run it.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.869
Once installed, there should be
an output from a tool called

00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:55.526
Nvidia smi and you should be
able to see your GPU here. If

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:58.935
you don't see it, you might have
to do some additional

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:02.592
troubleshooting. You'll then
need to run the command 'make

00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:06.373
run' from within the code base
folder. If you don't have the

00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:09.782
'make' utility installed, you'll
get prompted with the

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:13.501
instructions on how to install
it from Linux. The programme

00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:17.220
will now walk you through the
configuration steps. Type out

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:20.753
the full path of the folder
where the videos you wish to

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:24.720
analyse are stored. Then it will
ask you if you want CPU or GPU

00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:28.067
processing, use your arrow keys
and enter to pick the

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:31.848
appropriate one, we recommend
GPU. Next you have a couple of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.567
options. So when code changes
are made to the code base, we

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:39.162
provide a prebuilt compiled
version of the tool to Docker

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:42.943
Hub which stores precompiled
images. The options are you can

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:46.353
1. take the recommended
production images.  2. You can

00:01:46.414 --> 00:01:49.638
take the bleeding edge dev
images which includes new

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.481
features at the test stage. Or
you can 3. build your own from

00:01:53.543 --> 00:01:57.200
the source code which you can
download if you don't want to

00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:01.043
use the pre-built version. If
you're going to upload in order

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:04.762
to share between partners and
collaborate you can choose if

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:08.357
you want to encrypt the secrets
used to connect, which we

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.262
recommend doing, or not. Now it
will start the long process of

00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:15.795
pulling down the various
containers we need. The time it

00:02:15.857 --> 00:02:19.576
takes will change based on your
network speed and hard drive

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:23.419
speed. Once it is complete you
can start processing either by

00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:27.200
staying in terminal, or follow
the link in the readme to use

00:02:27.262 --> 00:02:29.060
the front end user interface.

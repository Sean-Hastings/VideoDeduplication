00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.732
Open the front-end user
interface via the link in the

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:07.551
GitHub readme and click on the
processing tab in the menu. Here

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:10.893
you'll find the configuration
settings. It will use the

00:00:10.953 --> 00:00:14.772
directory you choose during the
installation as a starting point

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:18.173
for processing, but if you want
to select a subdirectory

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:22.470
instead, you can do so here. You
could choose specific file extensions.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.161
Frame sampling. This allows you
to select how often you want to

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:41.083
sample each frame. For example,
once every x seconds, if you

00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:45.199
increase this time, there would
be less frames overall, helping

00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:48.607
save hard drive space and
increase processing speed.

00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:52.143
However, you might lose some
results if you sample too

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:55.809
infrequently. The recommended
default is one frame every

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:59.538
second. Match distance. This is
how closely it matches up

00:00:59.603 --> 00:01:03.332
similar content, we would
recommend keeping the default of

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:07.319
0.75. If you lower it to a 0.4
it will only show very similar

00:01:07.384 --> 00:01:11.113
matches whereas 0.75 shows you
both duplicates and similar

00:01:11.177 --> 00:01:14.907
content. Darkness threshold.
This is the level at which it

00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:18.958
removes videos that might have
been corrupted or shot at night

00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:22.817
causing the entire video to be a
black screen. We recommend

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:26.803
starting with the default of two
and if you want to adjust it

00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:30.919
later, you can do so.  Minimum
duration. This filters out short

00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:34.906
videos .Filter dark videos. This
is the switch to remove dark

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.250
videos based on the darkness
threshold shown above.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.160
Once configured, you can hit the
run button to start processing.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.170
Once it's finished processing,
you can view the log here now

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.480
you're ready to go to your
collection and view the newly

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.650
processed videos
